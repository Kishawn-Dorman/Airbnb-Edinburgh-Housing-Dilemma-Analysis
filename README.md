# Data-Mining-&-Analysis-Project
In this project, recommendations and insights are generated to tackle the problem described in the section to follow (i.e. About the project). Firstly exploratory data analysis was used on the "Listings" dataset [can be found here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). I then perform data preparation (which involves data cleaning, variable reduction, variable creation) using Microsoft Excel. Lastly using Python a cluster analysis is executed, followed by a decision tree (classification model) to classify a type/group (cluster) Airbnb hosts in Edinburgh that maybe engaged in illegal short term rental.

## About the project
“Airbnb offers you someone’s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel” (Rawes & Lacoma, 2021). This simply concept was seen as an opportunity for travellers to have cheaper accommodation prices and for home owners to monetize unused extra housing space. More than that Airbnb’s concept and popularity has made them become a fierce competitor for hotels (Atravellersfootsteps, 2017) and has lead them to being lauded by visitors and hosts as the modern temporary accommodation provider. However, there have been some echoes of the indirect impact Airbnbs are having on communities. Resistance from homeowners and residents in communities with Airbnbs has intensified because of the issues below. 

1.	Pressure property owners into “switching from long-term tenancies to short-term rentals”. This may reduce housing availability through increased rent prices and by extension increase housing prices (Guttentag, 2018).
2.	Bring disturbances with noise and mess from large groups (house party bookings) (Salboy Limited, 2022).
3.	Influence the atmosphere and ethos of these communities because of “over-tourism” (i.e. too many visitors) (Gallagher, 2021).

### Problem Statement
It has been suggested that these impacts are fuelled by Airbnb hosts renting out their residential properties as illegal short-term rentals. To follow up on this report, I've explored data on listings from Edinburgh to provide insights into the hosts in Edinburgh renting out their properties as illegal short-term rentals (consistently like a hotel) rather than legal short-term rentals (occasionally).
